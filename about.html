  <h1 class = "solid">About Me</h1>
  <p>I was born in North Carolina, specifically UNC hospital, which is why I've been a UNC sports fan for as long as I can remember. I moved to Albany when I was 5, and have lived there ever since. I learned to play hockey when I was little, and I played it up until highschool, when I started to wrestle instead. I wrestled all through highschool and I finished my senior year with a 45-12 record and a second place finish at sectionals. I enrolled in SUNY Buffalo this fall, and so far, so good. My major is Computer Science, and I'm loving every second of it. I'm 18 years old, and I have no intention of slowing down.
