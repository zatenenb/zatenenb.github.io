  <p>I was born in North Carolina, specifically UNC hospital, which is why I've been a UNC sports fan for as long as I can remember. I moved to Albany when I was 5, and have lived there ever since. I learned to play hockey when I was little, and I played it up until highschool, when I started to wrestle instead. I wrestled all through highschool and I finished my senior year with a 45-12 record and a second place finish at sectionals. I enrolled in SUNY Buffalo this fall, and so far, so good. My major is Computer Science, and I'm loving every second of it. If you want to keep up with me, here's
