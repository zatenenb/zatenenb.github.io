	<h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>I was born in North Carolina, specifically UNC hospital, which is why I've been a UNC sports fan for as long as I can remember. I moved to Albany when I was 5, and have lived there ever since. I learned to play hockey when I was little, and I played it up until highschool, when I started to wrestle instead. I wrestled all through highschool and I was very good at it. I enrolled in SUNY Buffalo this fall, and so far, so good. My major is Computer Science, and I'm loving every second of it.
